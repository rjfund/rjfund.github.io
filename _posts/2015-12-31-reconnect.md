## Pre-Charge Diversion ##

IN 2014, (Peter)[https://rjfund.github.io/team.html] created the Neighborhood Justice Program (NJP) for the Los Angeles City Attorney's office, a pre-charge diversion program that offers first-time, low-level, adult offenders the chance to avoid the traditional criminal justice system in favor of a community-based alternative that engages locals that live around where they committed the crime. Cheaper and more effective than being charged with a crime and becoming a defendant, NJP is now the largest program of its kind in the country, diverting thousands of people every year, saving LA County millions of dollars, and all with a recidivism rate of three percent.

Diversion programs like NJP have the potential to change the center of gravity in criminal justice by taking thousands of people out of the a system that is already overwhelmed with cases. Meanwhile, by being diverted to a community-based alternative before they ever get charged with a crime, the would-be defendant avoids all of the  collateral consequences of crimional justice and, in the process, saves time, money, and lives.
