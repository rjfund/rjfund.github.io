### Paralegal certification for prisoners and former prisoners who honed their legal skills in prison law libraries over decades (so-called "jailhouse lawyers") to obtain a well-paying job in the legal industry.

Frustrated with their lack of access to lawyers in prison, some prisoners begin doing the work themselves, becoming skilled litigators in their own right. They should be able to put their hard-won legal skills to use (and for pay!) when they come home  

> RJFund has partnered with [Goodwill Industries](https://www.goodwillsocal.org/) to begin enrolling formerly incarcerated people in credit-bearing courses they need to become certified paralegals.
