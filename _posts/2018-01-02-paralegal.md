### Paralegal certification for prisoners and former prisoners who honed their legal skills in prison law libraries over decades (so-called "jailhouse lawyers") to obtain a well-paying job in the legal industry upon release.

Prisoners are entrenched in the civil and criminal legal system, the navigation of which requires a specialized legal skillset. Frustrated with their lack of access to lawyers in prison, some prisoners begin doing the work themselves. Many become skilled litigators in their own right, arguing and winning cases on behalf of themselves and other prisoners. 

> RJFund has partnered with [Goodwill Industries](https://www.goodwillsocal.org/) to begin enrolling formerly incarcerated people in credit-bearing courses they need to become certified paralegals.
