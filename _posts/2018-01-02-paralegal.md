### Paralegal certification for prisoners and former prisoners who have honed their legal skills in prison law libraries over decades (so-called "jailhouse lawyers") so that they may apply their love of the law to obtain a well-paying job when they come home.

Prisoners are entrenched in the civil and criminal legal system, the navigation of which requires a specialized legal skillset. Frustrated with their lack of access to lawyers in prison, some prisoners begin doing the work themselves. Many become skilled litigators in their own right, arguing and winning cases on behalf of themselves and other prisoners. IF they retain their passion for the law when they are released, formerly incarcerated people should be able to put their hard-won legal skills to use at well-paying jobs with legitimate lawyers and law firms. 

> RJFund has partnered with [Goodwill Industries](https://www.goodwillsocal.org/) to begin enrolling formerly incarcerated people in credit-bearing courses they need to become certified paralegals.
