### Collect the oral histories of recently returned lifers to learn from their experiences and begin to understand the long-term psychological and emotional effects of incarceration.

There is virtually no data on if and how time spent in prison changes an individual's personality: There are no surveys done inside prison and no exit interview when a prisoner is released. We are missing an extremely valuable opportunity to learn exactly how mass incarceration effects the people most touched by it: the prisoners themselves.

> As our network of [Lifer Legal](https://www.lifer-legal.com) clients has grown, we've begun collecting the oral histories of recently returned lifers, a first-of-its-kind archive of stories that will create the foundation for research and academic work around the experience and effects of long-term incarceration.
