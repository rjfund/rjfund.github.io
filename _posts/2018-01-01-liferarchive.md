### Oral history collection demonstrating the transformation that can happen even while incarcerated and the challenges upon release.

There is virtually no data on if and how time spent in prison changes an individual's personality: There are no surveys done inside prison and no exit interview when a prisoner is released. We are missing an extremely valuable opportunity to learn exactly how mass incarceration effects the people most touched by it: the prisoners themselves.

> As our network of [Lifer Legal](https://www.lifer-legal.com) clients has grown, we've begun recording the oral histories of recently returned lifers, a first-of-its-kind archive of stories that will create the foundation for research and academic work around the experience and effects of long-term incarceration.
