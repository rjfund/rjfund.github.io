### Provide full-service legal representation to incarcerated and formerly incarcerated people in civil court to recover property that was stolen from them as a result of their long-term prison sentences.

We estimate that as many as one-third of California prisoners are at risk of being victims of theft. They need lawyers to help protect their assets and file civil lawsuits in the event that they have been stolen from to ensure they have access to vital resources when they come home.

> Since 2016, Lifer Legal attorneys have recovered more than one million dollars in cash and houses for prisoners and former prisoners.
