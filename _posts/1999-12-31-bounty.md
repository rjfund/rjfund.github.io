## Bounty Program for Cannabis Expungements ##

In 2017, RJFund won Santa Monica's [Hack the Beach](https://www.santamonica.gov/blog/hack-the-beach-building-real-solutions-for-real-problems) pitch contest with Minder, a mobile app for first responders to match their patients to crisis mental health beds instead of being arrested.

* Check out the [winning pitch deck](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mzLAxxEzorgXZuy-oyL5RWmORW8aEhSZ/view?usp=sharing) for Minder<br>
* Minder is built on California's [Welfare and Institutions Code section 5150](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=WIC&sectionNum=5150), or just "5150" for short, which outlines the proccess to place someone in mental health crisis on a three-day psychriatic hold and matched to a bed.
