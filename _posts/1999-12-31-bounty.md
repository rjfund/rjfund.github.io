## Bounty Program for Cannabis Expungements ##

By offering a fixed dollar amount for each expungement of cannabis-related offenses under Proposition 64, paralegals and non-lawyers can get involved with bringing equity to the recent legalizing of cannabis by helping clear the backlog of Californians eligible for expungement. 

* Despite passing [Proposition 64](https://ballotpedia.org/California_Proposition_64,_Marijuana_Legalization_(2016)) in 2016, millions of Californians still have cannabis-related convictions on their record.
* Expunging criminal records of cannabis-related offenses does not require an attorney and removes obstacles to getting a job, applying for a loan, or obtaining a professional license.
